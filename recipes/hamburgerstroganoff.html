            <strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Brown the beef: </strong>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground
                beef and cook until browned, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Saute onions and garlic: </strong>Add chopped onions and minced garlic to the beef. Cook for
                2-3 minutes until the onions are softened and fragrant</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the mushrooms: </strong>Stir in the mushrooms and cook until they soften, about 
                5 minutes.</li>                
                <li><strong>Make the sauce: </strong>Sprinkle the flour over the beef and mushrooms, stirring to combine. 
                Slowly pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add Worcestershire sauce and season 
                with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Simmer: </strong>Let the mixture simmer for 5-10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken 
                slightly.</li>
                <li><strong>Add sour cream: </strong>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the sour cream until the 
                sauce is creamy and smooth.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Spoon the Hamburger Stroganoff over cooked egg noodles and garnish with 
                fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
            </ol>

            <strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the beef rolls: </strong>Lay the beef slices flat and spread each with mustard. Season 
                with salt and pepper, then place a slice of bacon, some chopped onion, and pickle slices on top of each.</li>
                <li><strong>Roll and secure the beef: </strong>Roll the beef tightly and secure each roll with kitchen twine
                or toothpicks.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown the rouladens: </strong>In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. 
                Brown the rouladen on all sides, then remove and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the sauce: </strong>In the same skillet, add the remaining onions and saute until golden. 
                Stir in the tomato paste, then sprinkle with flour. Slowly add the beef broth and red wine, stirring 
                constantly to create a smooth sauce. Add the bay leaf.</li>
                <li><strong>Braise the rouladen: </strong>Return the rouladen to the skillet, cover, and let them simmer 
                over low heat for 1.5 to 2 hours until the beef is tender.</li>
                <li><strong>Finish the sauce: </strong>Once the rouladen are cooked, remove them from the skillet. Stir 
                in the butter to enrich the sauce, and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Remove the kitchen twine or toothpicks from the rouladen and server with the 
                gravy. Pair with mashed potatoes or German dumplings for a complete meal.</li>
            </ol>

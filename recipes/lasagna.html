        <h2>What is Lasagna?</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy bechamel, and melted
            cheese. Each layer brings a comforting combination of flavors, from the tangy tomato sauce and seasoned
            ground beef to the smooth, cheesy topping that browns perfectly in the oven. This hearty meal is perfect
            for family gatherings or a cozy night in, offering a satisfying blend of textures and tastes.

            <strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cook the noodles: </strong>Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain
                and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the meat sauce: </strong>In a large pan, saute onions and garlic in olive oil. Add
                ground beef or Italian sausage and cook until browned. Stir in marinara sauce and let simmer for 10-15
                minutes. Season with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix the cheese filling: </strong>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, eggs, half of the mozarella,
                half of the parmesan, and fresh herbs like basil or parsley. Stir until smooth.</li>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven: </strong>Set the oven to 375 F (190 C).</li>
                <li><strong>Layer the lasagna:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
                        <li>Place a layer of noddles over the sauce.</li>
                        <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles</li>
                        <li>Add a layer of meat sauce on top of the cheese.</li>
                        <li>Repeat these layers (noodles, cheese, meat sauce) until the dish is full, ending with a layer
                            of meat sauce on top</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Top with cheese: </strong>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese over the top
                layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Cover the lasagna with foil (to prevent burning the cheese) and bake for 25-30
                minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
                <li><strong>Let it rest: </strong>Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for 10-15 minutes before
                cutting and serving. This helps the layers set.</li>
            </ol>
